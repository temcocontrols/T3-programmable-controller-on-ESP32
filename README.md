Once the device is configured T3000 is not required, you can use your usual modbus and bacnet tools to read & write data through the various communications ports. T3000 can also be used to write programs running on the ESP as well as set up alarms, floorplans, data logging, emailed alarms and more. If you want to use the ESP32 as a router only that is fine as well, it will transparently route messages from one network to the other using 'transparent mode'.
